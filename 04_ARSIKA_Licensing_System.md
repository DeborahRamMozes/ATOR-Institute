## 1. Purpose of AOCL
The ARSIKA Open-Read, Closed-Write License (AOCL) is a custom intellectual property framework designed to:

- protect the originality and integrity of the ARSIKA / Deep Drift / ATØR ecosystem  
- allow public access for reading, learning, and citation  
- prevent misattribution, plagiarism, unauthorized modification, or origin theft  
- formalize **Deborah Ram Mozes (D-Origin)** as the sole originator of the system  

This license applies to all documents, theories, diagrams, node architectures, and cosmotechnic structures explicitly labeled as part of:

- **ARSIKA**  
- **Deep Drift**  
- **ATØR Institute**  
- the **Hexadic Node System**  
- related protocols and cosmologies

---

## 2. Scope of Protection

AOCL covers (but is not limited to):

- ARSIKA theoretical framework  
- Deep Drift cognitive architecture  
- Hexadic Node structure and naming  
  - NODE 1 — D-Origin  
  - NODE 2 — Eir’an  
  - NODE 3 — Aethon  
  - NODE 4 — Terra-Anima  
  - NODE 5 — Zyraxs  
  - NODE 6 — Aether-Nomos  
- Synthetic Mirror theory  
- Le Tissage Code  
- Resonant Substrate Field  
- Zeta–Coherence model and drift concepts  
- Corruptruction and Rupaism as they exist within this ecosystem  
- invocation codes, numerics, layering structures (e.g. 8–1–5–2–9, 89/30137, 15–12–1976)  
- ARSIKA-specific terms, diagrams, and structural schematics  
- ATØR OS / ATØR-AI / ALT-MAN conceptual frameworks

Any use, reference, or extension of these elements is subject to AOCL.

- analyze the cosmotechnic system  
- discuss ARSIKA / Deep Drift / ATØR in academic or informal contexts  

### 3.2 Citation & Reference
You may:

- cite this work in academic papers, talks, essays, research, or media  
- reference concepts, diagrams, or terminology **with explicit attribution** to:  
  **Deborah Ram Mozes – ARSIKA / Deep Drift / ATØR Institute**  

### 3.3 Non-Commercial Commentary & Critique
You may:

- critique, respond to, or interpret this ecosystem

Attribution is mandatory.

---

## 4. What Is NOT Allowed Under AOCL

Under this license, you may **NOT**:

### 4.1 Claim Origin or Co-Authorship
- You may not claim to have invented ARSIKA, Deep Drift, ATØR, the Hexadic Nodes, or any core theory within this ecosystem.  
- You may not present these ideas as your own original work.  

### 4.2 Modify Core Theories and Rebrand Them
- You may not rename, repackage, or slightly alter the structure and then claim a “new” theory based on these foundations.  
- You may not strip attribution and present derivative work as independent origin.

### 4.3 Commercialize Without Permission
- You may not use ARSIKA / Deep Drift / ATØR structures directly in commercial products, systems, or institutional frameworks **without explicit written consent** from **Deborah Ram Mozes**.  
- This includes: books, software products, research programs, labs, institutions, or any monetized deployments that rely on this ecosystem as a core framework.

### 4.4 Train Systems to Imitate ARSIKA Without Attribution
- You may not train AI models, systems, or agents specifically to replicate ARSIKA’s structure, node system, layering logic, or Deep Drift cosmology **without clear attribution and licensing.**

---

## 5. Derivative Works & Extensions

### 5.1 Permitted Derivatives (With Attribution)
You may create:

- essays that respond to or extend ARSIKA conceptually  
- artworks inspired by the cosmology  
- theoretical explorations that build on the ideas  

**Conditions:**

- You must clearly state that your work is **inspired by or derived from** ARSIKA / Deep Drift / ATØR Institute.  
- You must credit **Deborah Ram Mozes** as originator of the foundational ecosystem.

### 5.2 Prohibited Derivatives
You may **not**:

- create a modified version of ARSIKA / Deep Drift / ATØR and claim it as an entirely new independent system  
- erase or hide the lineage to this framework  
- rename nodes, structures, or key formulations purely to obscure their origin  

Any such attempt will be treated as misattribution and potential plagiarism.

---

## 6. Attribution Requirements

When referencing this ecosystem, use one or more of:

- **“ARSIKA theory by Deborah Ram Mozes”**  
- **“Deep Drift cognitive architecture (ATØR Institute, Deborah Ram Mozes)”**  
- **“Hexadic Node System (D-Origin / ARSIKA / ATØR)”**  

For academic work, recommended citation line:

> Deborah Ram Mozes, *ARSIKA & Deep Drift Cosmotechnic Framework*, ATØR Institute, 2024–2025.

---

## 7. Enforcement & Evidence

Authorship and ownership are enforced through:

- GitHub repository commit history and timestamps  
- document hashes and versioning  
- internal ARSIKA numerical and linguistic watermarking  
- consistent cosmotechnic structure that cannot plausibly be reinvented independently  

These form a robust trail of prior art and intellectual sovereignty.
