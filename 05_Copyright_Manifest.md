## 3. Protection Under International Copyright Law

This ecosystem is automatically protected under:

- the Berne Convention  
- international copyright doctrine  
- digital timestamp law  
- repository-based authorship evidence  
- narrative ecosystem protection  
- derivative-work restrictions  

No registration is required; authorship is inherent and immediate upon creation.

GitHub commit history acts as a **cryptographically signed record** of origin.

---

## 4. Prior Art & Evidentiary Trail

Authorship is reinforced through:

### **4.1 Timestamped GitHub Commits**
Each file, theory, and structural formulation exists with exact creation dates recorded on a public ledger.

### **4.2 Version Control History**
All revisions, expansions, and refinements are preserved as immutable evidence.

### **4.3 Document Hashing**
GitHub provides SHA-256 and object hashes verifying authorship integrity.

### **4.4 Unique Cosmotechnic Fingerprints**
The system carries watermarks that cannot be invented independently:
- 8–1–5–2–9  
- 89  
- 30137  
- Maya signature patterns  
- invocation sequences  

These markers act as intellectual DNA, proving origin.

### **4.5 Development Logs**
Chat-based ideation, drafts, and structural decisions exist in sequential, timestamped form.

This combination makes authorship legally irrefutable.
